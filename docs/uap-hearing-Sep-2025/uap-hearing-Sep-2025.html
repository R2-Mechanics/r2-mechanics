    Executive Summary: Congressional Hearing on UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection is the strongest choice.
   </h2>
   <p>
    The Congressional hearing focuses on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and whistleblower protection, with witnesses detailing their experiences with UAP sightings and subsequent retaliation or obstruction from government agencies. The hearing aims to establish transparency and accountability within the executive branch, addressing concerns about secrecy and potential cover-ups. Witnesses highlight a pattern of dismissed whistleblower reports, particularly from military pilots fearing career repercussions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The testimony reveals significant frustration with existing UAP investigative structures, including the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AERO), and allegations of intentional obstruction of thorough investigations into UAP activity. The hearing aims to address national security implications, demand transparency from the Department of Defense and intelligence community regarding UAPs, and establish accountability for past inaction or cover-ups.
   </p>
   <p>
    The conversation underscores Congressional efforts to compel greater transparency and whistleblower protections, with a focus on protecting those who come forward with UAP-related information. Witnesses express concerns about potential systemic issues with governmental transparency and oversight regarding UAP-related programs and protections for those reporting such activity. The hearing highlights the importance of establishing safe channels for federal employees to report UAP-related concerns without fear of reprisal, linking this to broader issues of government accountability and public trust.

      I've spoken now to a number of whistleblowers from the military to include the infamous Eglin Air Force Base incident that occurred when myself and former Representative Matt Gaetz, as well as Representative Burchett, followed up on a lead from multiple active duty Air Force pilot whistleblowers that alleged that the United States Air Force was covering up UAP activity at Eglin Air Force Base. We have heard from a number of whistleblowers, specifically military pilots, that the reason for not coming forward publicly is out of fear that speaking out would cost them their flight status and potentially their careers. This is unacceptable. We cannot protect our air spaces if our best trained observers are silenced. We cannot advance science if we refuse to ask questions. And we cannot maintain trust in government if we keep the American people in the dark. Now Congress has tried to fix this problem. Congress tried to create formal channels through the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, also known as AERO, and the Intelligence Community Inspector General for service members and officials to make disclosures.

       UAP Disclosures
      </h3>
      <p>
       Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) are events or objects that cannot be identified by conventional means and have been the subject of government investigations for decades. The term "UFO" is often used interchangeably, but UAP refers specifically to anomalous phenomena in military airspace.

      But the reality, the reports come in are often to brush aside, slow walked or met with skepticism rather than serious investigation. Recently, the former Arrow director known as Sean Kilpatrick attacked our witnesses and members on this committee. It should be noted that he's a documented liar and brings into question what his purpose at Arrow really was if it was not to follow up on investigations and disclose his findings to members of Congress. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Chris Mellon, described a report published by Arrow that found no evidence that any USG investigation, academic-sponsored research, or official review panel has confirmed any citing of UAP-represented extraterrestrial technology. As the most error-ridden and unsatisfactory government report I can recall reading during after decades of government service. Mellon further noted that this was a first-air report submitted to Congress without the Director of National Intelligence's sign-off and seemingly excluded input from any scholars or experts who have studied or written extensively about this topic, as would normally be in any other case in this field.

       Whistleblower Protection

      <p>
       Military pilots who witness UAP activity may fear speaking out publicly due to potential career consequences such as losing their flight status or facing retaliation from superiors. The establishment of formal channels like AERO aims to provide protection for whistleblowers and encourage them to come forward with information about UAPs without fear of reprisal.

      Mellon determined that this report failed to fulfill the congressional mandate under which it was required, omitted entire agencies with known investigations or activities related to UAPs, and omitted any discussion of efforts to hide classified or unclassified information about UAP. Such efforts were unaddressed by the report despite the existence of agency records and investigations concurring with them, including those at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If we set up offices and oversight bodies only to let them become graveyards for testimony, or worse yet, ruses for pretending to investigate when in actuality there was no follow-up, then we are not doing our jobs. In recent months, Congress has also been presented with evidence that points to technologies that to our knowledge are beyond our current capabilities. It is our duty as elected representatives to follow the facts wherever they lead and to ensure that those facts are not buried under classification stamps or bureaucratic excuses. Let me be clear, whether UAPs represent adversarial technology, natural phenomena, or something beyond current human understanding, Congress has a responsibility to investigate.

      If these objects are foreign in origin, then they pose a direct threat to our national security. And if they represent something unknown, they demand rigorous scientific inquiry, not ridicule, not secrecy, and not silence. The stakes are very high. Adversarial nations are not waiting for us to catch up. They are studying these phenomena as well aggressively, as multiple nations have also announced their own parliamentary investigations into this very topic. If we are to continue to hide information from ourselves, we risk strategic surprise. If we continue to ignore our pilots and service members, as well as countless government whistleblowers, we risk losing their trust. And if we continue to shield the truth from the public, we risk eroding the very foundation of democratic accountability. This is why this hearing matters. This is not about fueling speculation. This is about demanding the basic transparency from the Department of Defense and the intelligence community and other military contractors. It is about asking the questions every American has the right to ask. What do we know? What don't we know? And why in a free society are we being told so little?

    UAP Oversight and Whistleblower Protection
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The Congressional hearing discusses transparency issues related to unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) investigations by the Department of Defense and intelligence community. It highlights a lack of cooperation, special access program rules restricting document viewing for non-committee members, and classified oversight reporting as barriers to inquiry. Witnesses emphasize that future generations will look back at this moment and question whether Congress pursued truth with courage or looked away from reality. The hearing also addresses the need to protect whistleblowers who report UAP incidents without fear of retaliation or professional consequences. Institutional Significance: This discussion highlights the importance of transparency, oversight, and protection for individuals reporting on UAPs in order to maintain government credibility and ensure effective policy-making.

      A major barrier to this committee's inquiry into UAPs has been the lack of cooperation and transparency from the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. In preparation for previous UAP hearings, the committee repeatedly asked the Department of Defense to allow members to view videos and files related to UAP incidences. Unfortunately, the Department of Defense notified the committee staff that due to the department's special access program rules, only members of the House Armed Service Committee as well as the Defense Subcommittee on House Appropriations, also known as HACD, were allowed to be read in onto such programs. For a noncommittee member to be allowed to view these documents and videos, individual members must be approved by the chairman and ranking member of both HASC and HACD. Independent SAP oversight has presented a consistent problem for Congress, as well as program budgets are classified. Additionally, oversight reporting to Congress is classified and only provided to the authorizing and appropriations committees of jurisdiction. The American people are not fragile. They do not need to be shielded like children from reality.

      Thank you so much, Madam Chair. At a time of increasing distrust in government, it is important for Congress to take action to restore the government's credibility. Bringing transparency to an issue of great public interest is a step toward doing just that. So I thank Chairwoman Luna for calling this bipartisan hearing to discuss unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP, which is today's term for what was commonly known as UFOs, unidentified flying objects. And while some people think of flying saucers when they hear these terms, it is vital that we focus on the real world impact of UAPs on critical infrastructure, civilian safety, and national security. There is good reason to believe that most UAPs have origins far closer to home. Currently, NASA has not found any evidence that any UAPs have an extraterrestrial origin. Our adversaries are working to develop new capabilities to gain military advantages, and those efforts are likely explanation for the mysteries that we have observed. Nevertheless, the federal government has a responsibility to the American people to investigate and provide transparent disclosures about every incident.

And Congress should do everything in its power to protect whistleblowers and conduct oversight of agencies that are failing to provide that protection. Democracy depends on transparency, and transparency often relies on the courage of individuals willing to risk their careers, reputations, and in some cases, their personal safety to tell the truth. So I look forward to hearing from the witnesses today. We should welcome their accounts and acknowledge the bravery they have shown to come before us. We must ensure that all whistleblowers feel that they can come to Congress to tell their stories without fear of retaliation or professional consequences. We need transparency not just to make better policy, but also to ensure that information flows between all those who need it. There are too many tragic examples in our history where information lapses and a lack of cross-agency coordination led to disaster. Just this year, failure to communicate between FAA and the Department of Defense led to tragedy over the Potomac.

    Testimonies and Oversight on UAP Disclosure Efforts
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The hearing featured testimonies from various witnesses including a United States Air Force veteran, a senior chief operations specialist in the Navy, an investigative reporter, and a policy counsel at Project of Government Oversight. Witnesses discussed their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) or UFO sightings, as well as efforts to establish transparency and accountability within government agencies regarding UAP reporting and investigations. The hearing aimed to promote whistleblower protection policies that encourage individuals to come forward without fear of retaliation while also fostering a comprehensive understanding of what is happening in our skies through the combination of civilian, commercial, and military sources.

      The Biden-Harris administration sought to eliminate some of these lapses when it established the all-domain anomaly resolution office at the Department of Defense. Aero can convene sources from all branches of military, the FAA, and NASA to combine forces to create a comprehensive picture of what is happening in our skies. Some UAP reports have perfectly normal explanations. Satellites, consumer drones, weather balloons, even pranks. But we need to track down each and every single UAP. The United States has millions of eyes in the sky, both electronic and human. But only the combination of civilian, commercial, and military sources can begin to create a complete picture. So we need to ensure that people can come forward and report what they have seen to the relevant authorities. And they have to have the right to do so without fear of retaliation. This country has a history of dedicated public servants standing up for what is right. even in the face of potential consequences. From the Pentagon Papers to Watergate to torture programs, whistleblowers have not only informed the public, but also empowered Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty of oversight.

      Thank you very much, Madam Chairman, ranking members, for allowing me to sit with you on this panel today. I'm honored to be able to introduce a witness here who is from my district, George Knapp, who has been the definitive expert and reporter on this topic that you're exploring today. UAPs or UFOs. George is a longtime friend, I would say that up front, but a very respected journalist and a recognized expert in this field nationally and internationally. Just a little something about George, he came to Las Vegas in 1979 and joined KLS television station as a general assignment reporter in 1981. Since 1995, he's been the chief investigative reporter for that channel. He also hosts a national radio show you can listen to on Coast to Coast AM which covers many of the paranormal topics that y'all are discussing. Over the years, George has been, as I said, recognized for his work. He's been honored with the Peabody Award, the DuPont Award, the Edward Murrow Award, and 27 different regional Emmys for his investigative reporting. Indeed, he has told Nevada's story with clarity, with objectivity, and with integrity.

    Testimony of Former Military Police Officer Jeffrey Nusatelli on UAP Incidents at Vandenberg Air Force Base
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In his testimony before the task force, former military police officer Jeffrey Nusatelli recounted multiple unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) incidents that occurred between 2003 and 2005 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. These events included sightings of massive glowing red squares, triangular crafts, and erratic lights over the ocean. Witnesses reported these UAPs to their superiors but received no guidance on how to handle them or address the situation. Nusatelli emphasized that transparency is crucial for addressing such incidents and urged Congress to fund independent research into UAP phenomena, end secrecy and over-classification of information, and protect witnesses who come forward with their experiences.

      Thank you, Chairwoman Luna, Ranking Member Crockett, and members of the task force. for giving us the opportunity to testify today. My name is Jeffrey Nusatelli. I'm a former military police officer with 16 years of active duty service in the US Air Force. I'm here today because the American people have both the right and the responsibility to know the truth about unidentified aerial phenomenon. That truth remains hidden, classified, and silenced by fear, retaliation, stigma, and confusion. Today we are here to help break that silence. Between 2003 and 2005, five UAP incidents occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base, home to the National Missile Defense Project, a top national security priority. At the time, we were conducting launches deemed by the National Reconnaissance Office as the most important in 25 years. These were historic launches. These facilities were vital and they were repeatedly visited by UAP. Each incident was witnessed by multiple personnel, documented, investigated, and reported up the chain of command. We sent information up, but we got no guidance down on how to handle these events.

      I personally witnessed one of these events and investigated others as they occurred. Six other service members have provided me with the information that I will share with you today. The incursions began on October 14, 2003, when Boeing contractors reported a massive glowing red square silently hovering over two missile defense sites. After several minutes, it drifted further east onto the base and vanished over the hills. This event, now known as the Vandenberg Red Square, was referenced by Representative Luna at the first hearing on this topic. Official Air Force records of this event are in possession by Arrow and the FBI. Later that night, while I was on duty, security guards at a critical launch site reported a bright, fast-moving object over the ocean. I responded to the incident. Chaos ensued over the radio as the object approached rapidly. I heard my friends screaming, it's coming right at us, it's coming right for us, and now it's right here. Moments later, I heard them say that it had shot off and was gone.

      When I arrived on scene, I talked to five shaken witnesses who described a massive triangular craft larger than a football field that hovered silently for about 45 seconds over their entry control point before shooting away at impossible speed. About a week later, another patrol reported a light over the ocean behaving erratically. Believing it might be an unannounced aircraft, they declared an emergency and an armed response force responded. Before the forces could arrive, the object descended and either landed or hovered on our flight line and then took off again at impossible speed. The witnesses to this event were threatened and intimidated afterward. They were told to keep quiet and think about what they were reporting. After that, things did get quiet until about 2005 when another patrol reported a massive triangular craft larger than a C-130 silently floating over the installation. He watched it for a few minutes. It traveled west and disappeared into the night. And then I had my own encounter, again in 2005.

      I was off duty, sitting in my backyard with two other police officers when we noticed what first appeared to be a satellite in orbit, but it wasn't acting like a satellite. The light was strange, it was pulsing, and then it started to maneuver. It dropped in elevation, at times it would vanish from view and reappear in a different location in the sky, and eventually it reappeared 200 feet over my house. It was a 30-foot diameter sphere of light. My friends and I watched it for a moment, and then it gently accelerated and traveled up and disappeared into the stars. These events profoundly changed my life and the lives of my friends. We stand at a pivotal moment in history. The question is no longer whether these events are real, but whether we have the courage to face them. True leadership requires vision, a willingness to confront the unknown with transparency and resolve. So I ask the Congress to help we the people enact this vision. There are three goals. Fund independent research and treat UAP study with the same seriousness as we would any other scientific field. Two, end secrecy and over-classification. Transparency is the foundation of truth.

       The speaker mentions how they sent information about UAP incidents up the chain of command but received no guidance on handling them. This highlights a lack of protocol or understanding within the military regarding these unexplained phenomena, which may have contributed to confusion and secrecy surrounding their occurrence.

      Without it, witnesses like us are dismissed. Three, protect the witnesses. Many stay silent out of fear for their careers, reputations, and the safety of their families. Protect them and you will embolden others to join this cause. These phenomenon challenge our deepest assumptions about reality, consciousness, and our place in the universe. Exploring them can unlock transformative breakthroughs in technology, biology, and human understanding. Let this be the moment when America chooses courage over fear, transparency over secrecy, and progress over stagnation. Let's show the world that our nation leads not only through strength, but through fearless pursuit of the truth.

    Testimony of U.S. Navy Operations Specialist Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Observations
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In his testimony before the Task Force and Committee, USN Operations Specialist Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins recounts an incident where he observed unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) off the coast of Southern California. The UAP were tic-tac shaped objects that emerged from the ocean and disappeared with a high synchronized near instantaneous acceleration. He emphasizes the need for standardized checklist, training to capture sensor data in real time, protection without retribution for sailors reporting UAP encounters, declassification and transparency where possible, and safe pathways for uniformed personnel to report evidence.

      Good morning, Chairwoman Luna, Ranking Member Crockett, and members of the Task Force and the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Alexandro Wiggins. I'm an active duty U.S. Navy Operations Specialist Senior Chief Petty Officer. Father of three and dedicated American testifying today in my personal capacity. The views I share are my own and I do not represent the official positions of the Department of the Navy or any subordinate organization. On the evening of February 15th, 2023, at approximately 1915 PST in the Whiskey 291 warning area off the coast of Southern California, I was serving on board USS Jackson. During that period, I moved between the Interior Communications Center, ICC-1, and the bridge wing correlating the sensor picture with visual observations, part of my routine responsibilities for surface and air picture management. What I observed and what our crew recorded was not consistent with conventional aircraft or drones as they appear on our system. A self-luminous tic-tac-shaped object emerged from the ocean before linking up with three other similar objects.

      The four then disappeared simultaneously with a high synchronized near instantaneous acceleration. I observed no sonic boom and no conventional propulsion signatures. no exhaust plume, no control surface articulation on the SAFIRE image system. Shortly after the synchronized departure, radar tracks dropped. These observations were multi-sensor and recorded inside of ICC-1 with time location overlay visible in our source frames that have been made public by journalists. From my experience operating in this region over many years, and consistent with our public characterized encounters, unidentified objects reoccur in United States operation areas off Southern California. That fact alone does not tell us what they are, but it does argue the systematic stigma-free reporting and for the preservation of sensor data so analysts can evaluate safe and intelligence implications with rigor. I want to underscore three points for the task force and the committee. Aviation and maritime safety. When crews and watchstanders observe objects that maneuver or accelerate in ways that does not match known profiles and do so near our ships and aircraft, that is first and foremost a safety issue.

      Standardized checklist and training should ensure we capture the best possible sensor data in real time, including IR settings, slant range estimates, and bearing and range altitude snapshots, and immediate change of chain of custody for any recordings. Reporting without stigma, protection without retribution. Sailors need to know that reporting UAP encounters will not harm their careers. Congress can help by reinforcing witness protection and by directing the relevant office to maintain confidential destigmatized channels for service members who step forward with data. Declassification and transparency where possible. The task force declassification mission is directly relevant here. where operational security permits releasing metadata-preserved sensor excerpts, or at least technical summaries, would improve public trust and accelerate outside scientific scrutiny. That includes, when feasible, the time geo-reference IR frames and radar parameters needed for independent analysis. To be clear, I am not here to make claims beyond my lane.

Great to see you here. I'm George Knapp, chief investigative reporter at KLAS-TV in Las Vegas. I began my pursuit of this weird mystery way back in 1987 and for 38 years I've always approached this as a news story. It's not a matter of faith or belief to me, it's a story and it's an important one. I'm proud to be here alongside these witnesses today, men who have seen strange things and stepped forward to tell the world about it. Whistleblowers and witnesses who step up are routinely insulted, belittled, or worse. They risk their reputations, their careers, their clearances, their livelihoods, and sometimes much more than that, even their freedom. I know that one of the goals of the task force here is to figure out ways to protect whistleblowers and witnesses, and it's a tall order because so many of the things that happen to witnesses like these are extra legal.

I want to share a couple of things that I've learned along the way on this long journey, and I submitted most of that in written form because I estimate that my statement here today would take about four and a half hours, so I'm going to try to jump over and touch on the more important salient points. I submitted the detailed written statement for the record, and we'll go into a lot of that here, but the public has been told over and over since the late 40s, there's nothing to worry about here. These mysterious craft seen by millions of people in the skies, in the oceans, over the land are not real. They're not a threat. The witnesses are wrong. They're crackpots. Don't believe it. That changed for me. What got me hooked is the paper trail. documents that were squeezed out of the U.S. government after the FOIA, Freedom of Information Act, became the law of the land. And those documents paint a much different picture than what the public, the press, and Congress have been told over many years.

      The documents from military and intelligence personnel behind closed doors admit that, quote, these things are real, they're not fictitious, they can fly in formation, they're evasive, and they outperform any aircraft known to exist, including ours. The public, of course, as I said, has been told something much different. Back in 1989, I reported about a guy named Bob Lazar, who claimed that he worked at a facility dubbed S4 out in the Nevada desert, very near to Area 51. He said he was part of a reverse engineering program He said, there are alien craft that will be taken apart to figure out how they operated out there. And that was a pretty tall order. I had clearly taken a dive into the deep end of the pool there. But in the years since then, I've interviewed dozens of other people. And I've detailed what their testimony has been in the written statement. They include Senator Harry Reid. Senator Howard Cannon, also of Nevada, a guy named Al O'Donnell, who was the first general manager of EG&amp;G in Nevada, which managed the Nevada test site, which blew up hundreds of nuclear weapons.

      There's a guy named Dr. James Lekatsky, who was a career scientist with the Defense Intelligence Agency, who was the guy who initiated a program called OSAP, Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Application Program, which is, as far as we know, the largest acknowledged UFO program ever funded by the US government, which put together an amazing pile of information that members of this committee and the world, most of which have never seen. The DIA still hasn't released 95% of what was prepared by that program at a cost of millions and millions of dollars. The one name I do want to bring up in this session, though, is Robert Bigelow. So looking into the idea of crash retrievals and reverse engineering, while OSAP, that program, was active, the DIA's contractor, Robert Bigelow of Las Vegas, made a bold attempt to acquire physical proof of UFO crashes. It's been widely reported and suspected that Lockheed Martin is one of the defense contractors that has held this stuff, stored it away in secrecy, and tried to figure out how it works.

      I have confirmed on the record that Robert Bigelow and a trusted colleague from OSAP met with and negotiated with senior executives at Lockheed Martin and hammered out a deal wherein Bigelow's company, Bass, would receive a quantity of unusual material that had been stashed away and protected at a facility in California. That material was not made here. I want to move on now to the Russia files, because that was going to be sort of the central impetus of what I was going to talk to you about today. Back in the early 90s, I got into Russia, met with a number of their defense officials, Ministry of Defense and others, who confirmed for me that Russia had been doing the same thing that the United States had been doing, that is, secretly studying UFOs while publicly saying something completely different. The documents and interviews that I obtained and have now shared with this task force show that the USSR launched what is almost certainly the largest UFO UAP investigation in the world.

      The first phase of that was an order was sent out to the entire USSR military empire that every unit, you see anything strange in the sky, a craft, an orb, something unusual, you had to gather all the evidence, collect testimony from the witnesses, look for physical evidence, and all of that information went into one program at the Ministry of Defense. Thousands and thousands of these reports came in. A lot of them were first routed to the KGB, but then back to another program that came after this collection effort called Thread 3. And Thread 3 was an analysis program. We provided to the committee the documents of what they were trying to do, and essentially, they were trying to build their own UFOs. They were using the information from their observations and studies to try to figure out that technology. The guy who was in charge of that program, Colonel Boris Sokolow, told me that their goal was to basically develop technology that would be superior to anything we had based on what they learned from UFOs.

      Good morning, members of the task force and the committee. I would like to express my gratitude for being invited to testify to the current task force created under the People's Chamber and the American public. As an American citizen, veteran, and intelligence community professional, it is an honor and a privilege to serve under oath before you on behalf of our country. I speak for myself and no former agency or company I have been previously affiliated with. My name is Dylan Borland, a former 1N1 geospatial intelligence specialist for the United States Air Force in an active duty enlisted capacity from 2010 to 2013. I've also been employed with BAE Systems and Intrepid Solutions as a senior analyst, expert in analyzing video radar and advanced electro-optical imagery for official identification of aerial order of battle as well as naval and ground order of battle. I'm a federal whistleblower having testified to both the ICIG and Arrow with direct firsthand knowledge of and experience with craft and technologies that are not ours and are reportedly operating without congressional oversight.

      Because of my direct knowledge of the reality of certain legacy UAP programs, my professional career was deliberately obstructed and I have endured sustained reprisals from government agencies for over a decade. From 2011 to 2013, I was stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia conducting 24 hour operations via manned and unmanned aerial vehicles for Special Operations Forces in the Global War on Terror. During the summer of 2012, my team was on standby for weather and I returned to my barracks on base and at approximately 0130, I saw an approximately 100 foot equilateral triangle take off from near the NASA hangar on the base. The craft interfered with my telephone did not have any sound, and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic. I was under this triangular craft for a few minutes, and then it rapidly ascended to commercial jet level in seconds, displaying zero kinetic disturbance, sound, or wind displacement. Some years after that experience, I was further exposed to classified information from the UAP Legacy Crash Retrieval Program through a sensitive position I held within a special access program.

      During this time, intelligence officers approached me in fear for their own careers, citing misconduct within these programs and similar retaliation that I was already enduring at this time. These issues include medical malpractice committed by Veterans Affairs staff, denial of work I performed while enlisted in the United States Air Force, forged and manipulated employment documents, workplace harassment including colleagues being directed to not speak with me, manipulation of my security clearance by certain agencies blocking, delaying, and ultimately removing my ability to be employed within the IC. The retaliation I face and the retaliation against individuals I know who worked in these programs is what convinced me in March 2023 to become a whistleblower. I came forward out of concern for people's lives and to ensure I did everything I could to let our elected representatives know the truth about what is really happening in the executive branch. At the end of March 2023, I agreed to meet with Arrow following the suggestion of other federal officials believing it was what our nation required of me.

      I had reservations with Arrow due to assessments they were reporting publicly at the time as a misrepresentation of the truth. Because of these concerns, I did not share sources and methods information in order to protect current and formal federal personnel who had firsthand exposure to technologies of unknown origin. I did not want anyone to face further retaliation beyond what they had already endured. And unfortunately, a staff member ended up getting in some trouble because of that. After David Grush testified under oath in the summer of 2023 and provided historic disclosure, I was then asked to go to the ICIG and did so in August 2023. It was very clear early on during my intake interview, which was video recorded under oath, that the objective was to solely assess how much I know and not move forward with an investigation with new information I provided them. The aftermath of that IG complaint still troubles me to this day. Since my ICIG complaint, I've been prevented from resuming prior employment and can confirm I'm still blacklisted from certain agencies within the intelligence community.

    Whistleblower Testimony and Oversight Challenges
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The speaker discusses their experience as a whistleblower within government agencies, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals who come forward to reveal information about UFO UAP matters. They emphasize the importance of transparency in maintaining democratic principles and protecting national security interests. Additionally, they express concern for fellow whistleblowers who have been discarded or isolated due to their actions. The speaker calls on Congress to strengthen protections for whistleblowers and encourages decision-makers to act upon critical information provided by these individuals. Institutional Significance: This testimony highlights the need for stronger oversight mechanisms within government agencies, particularly in relation to national security matters involving UFO UAP phenomena. It also emphasizes the importance of protecting whistleblowers who provide valuable insights into potential corruption or misconduct within their organizations. By addressing these issues, Congress can ensure that transparency and accountability are maintained throughout all levels of governance, ultimately benefiting both citizens and policymakers alike.

      In addition, multiple agencies attempted phishing attacks to assess what I had divulged to the Inspector General, including being asked to disclose details of my ICIG complaint during a CI polygraph or a position unrelated to UFO UAP matters as recently as November 2024. As I sit before you today, I and many other whistleblowers have no job prospects, no foreseeable professional future in a nation every single one of us came forward to defend. Numerous individuals have come forward in various ways to reveal the truth of the UAP reality as patriots and defenders of our nation, yet many feel discarded, isolated, hopeless, separated from the country they serve. Efforts to rectify this situation for all whistleblowers have been difficult and troubling, and to my fellow whistleblowers and officials who know this information, I offer you my apology, something that I have never gotten, and I'm giving it to you. I swore an oath to the Constitution of the United States, an oath that demands truth and transparency for our democratic republic to function. Each day these truths remain hidden from our citizens. Humanity drifts further from the principles our nation was founded to uphold.

      Chairwoman Luna, Ranking Member Crockett, and Task Force members, thank you for the opportunity to testify here today about the importance of strengthening whistleblower protections, especially in the context of national security. I am a senior policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan independent watchdog organization that investigates and exposes waste, corruption, abuse of power, and when the government fails to serve the public or silences those who report wrongdoing. Whistleblowers are the first line of defense to root out waste, fraud, abuse of power, and corruption in our government. Congress relies on whistleblowers so that it can fully exercise its oversight and legislative authorities. It's understandable that former presidents of both parties have often taken a hostile approach toward whistleblowers. Their disclosures can embarrass the president and their political party or even lead to a national scandal. but whistleblowers continue to play a vital role during both Democratic and Republican administrations. They help Congress and the public identify and understand what government corruption looks like.

      Their disclosures fuel investigations and allow us to address wrongdoing and hold those responsible to account. That's why historically there's been a strong bipartisan consensus in Congress to support and protect whistleblowers. Doing so protects the country and ensures our government is more responsive and accountable to the people. National security whistleblowing, in particular, is a tradition going back to the founding of our country. And over time, national security whistleblowers and their disclosures have impacted some of the most fundamental issues and questions about how we wish to be governed and how our government can better serve its people. from the role the U.S. plays around the world to holding powerful actors accountable, government ethics and transparency, human rights and civil liberties, executive branch authority, First Amendment freedoms of speech and dissent, freedom of the press, and the public's interest and right to know. Despite this invaluable public service, blowing the whistle comes at great personal risk. Whistleblowers risk losing their jobs, careers, livelihoods, and reputations.

      They can face retaliatory investigations, lawsuits, and even serious criminal charges. And they can endure deep mental, emotional, and psychological harm. All of that risk to speak the truth, to ensure that agencies fulfill their core missions, and that they serve the best interests of the people. Those who retaliate against whistleblowers don't just violate their legal rights, they inflict real harm on our government and betray the public's trust. Targeting whistleblowers instead of the corruption they expose wastes agency resources and further allows that corruption to continue unaddressed. It can instill a chilling effect across an agency, fostering a climate of fear and distrust, quieting dissent and free speech, and deterring potential whistleblowers from coming forward in the future. Whistleblowers are often some of the most dedicated and principled public servants we have because of their willingness to put themselves on the line to do what's right.

    Whistleblower Protection and UAP Disclosure Oversight
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The speaker emphasizes the need for whistleblowers to have safe channels of disclosure, stronger protections against retaliation, and a fair chance at justice when facing retaliatory actions. They also highlight how politicization has impacted support for whistleblowers in Congress. In response to questioning from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (Chairwoman), witness Dylan Borland (UAP Witness) shares their experience witnessing large triangular craft while stationed at Langley Air Force Base in 2012 and discusses the potential consequences of disclosing such information within the intelligence community.

      and Congress has historically supported them, again, on a bipartisan basis, but unfortunately whistleblowing has increasingly become more politicized with support for whistleblowers often hinging on which party is in power and which party is politically inconvenienced by the misconduct being exposed. But to be clear, targeting whistleblowers individually risks undermining whistleblowing, period. POGO advises members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to focus on the evidence, not the individual. We will always need whistleblowers to achieve the government that best serves its people, because when people of conscience, integrity, and good character refuse to speak up out of fear, complacency, or self-preservation, and leave corruption to fester behind closed doors, that is probably the most dangerous risk of all. If we are serious about increasing government transparency and restoring the public's trust, we need public servants committed to the truth. Whistleblowers need safe and effective channels to make lawful disclosures. They need stronger protections against retaliation. And when they do face retaliation, they need a fair shot to be made whole.

      Great question, ma'am. So on barracks, on the base, I lived in the barracks. There was a little smoke pit outside. I was there on the telephone and looking across to the flight line, and I see a white light pop up and stop about 100 feet in the air. I thought it was a weather balloon. I've seen tests from there before, weeknight, normal thing, not surprising. I actually finished my cigarette, and I began walking up towards the flight line. There is a track, and because I was on three months of night work, I would walk the track at night when we were weathered down. And as I began walking towards the light, towards the flight line and the track, the light then flies across the base, across the flight line, and as it flies to me, a triangle... manifests around the light. I can't tell you if it's active camouflage. I can't tell you if it appeared around the light, but I can tell you that it was a white light and then it was a triangle. It stopped about 100 feet in front of me and approximately 100 feet above me. My telephone got extremely hot, completely froze, dead. I remember how thick it was. It was between one to two stories thick, equilateral triangle.

      I could never see the top of it, and the edges were 90 degrees. There were four lights in total, one light on each corner and a larger light in the center, two to three times the size of the corner lights. But what was really odd was the outside, the best way to describe it is like looking at a James Webb telescope picture where you have the colors and then the black background. So the craft itself was this black metallic flake paint, but on top of the craft was this gold, lava, plasma, some type of fluid going over and around the craft. I'm under this for about two to three minutes, and then the center light flashes two to three times, no sound, immediately shoots up to commercial jet level minimum, in my opinion, and I immediately feel static electricity all over my body, and then I smell the smell of after a thunderstorm or lightning storm, that really strong summer thunderstorm smell. Gets up to flight level. I'm trying to get my phone reset and I can only see the center light at this point. If I didn't actually see it take off, I would have thought it was a star.

      It's a difficult question to answer. I think prior to David Grush and people beginning this process of bringing people into awareness of the reality of these programs and certain things people have witnessed, probably extremely widespread. I think today there's still an issue, but because people are able to come before you and people are speaking out, I think it has been Somewhat less I would hope though that people would because if this goes back into closed doors, this is gonna get really ugly What type of behavior have you witnessed from former Aero director Sean Kilpatrick as well as his staff and relate to this information you provided to them?

      Good question. The problem with this is that I know what I experienced firsthand and I know other things. I think the staff at Arrow that I met with in March of 2023, I think they were good people doing the job they were told to do. I did not meet with Kirkpatrick. He was either not present or did not want to meet me that day. However, they did classify information about the reality of this subject and It was very concerning because in my Arrow MFR, they had actually referenced a former staff member that was the one who told me to go there, and they probably shouldn't have done that.

It would be much better if you pulled up in Winnebago's and were wearing hats. And so the picture of this, because that's important for the American people on how you tell a story, what the message looks like, and who the messenger is. So this is now the second or third committee where we have former military folks with impeccable records, with information and knowledge. And it's definitely clear on a bipartisan basis that we have to protect our whistleblowers. There's no doubt. And in a day in which it's really hard to tell what's true or not from a political standpoint. And so I don't really know what is true. I don't know on this subject.

They didn't say it was broken. So we look at that and we see something. So it's either a weapons program being reverse engineered by our governments or other governments, or it's nobody's government and it's not from here. Those are it. You agree with that assessment?

    UAP Witness Testimonies and Oversight Challenges
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In a recent Congressional hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), witnesses shared their experiences with encounters involving mysterious objects. The discussion highlighted the challenges faced by individuals who report such incidents, including potential career consequences and concerns over safety. Additionally, it was noted that some UAP sightings could be attributed to foreign governments or advanced technologies developed in secret programs like Arrow.

      I actually kind of laughed to myself and said, okay, so this exists as well. Worked in enough programs, been exposed to enough that I was like, okay, so this is a real thing. I went back, walked the track, talked with a couple of my friends about it. I did talk with some of my coworkers, one in particular, which I thought was a joke, and it definitely wasn't, was like, you probably should never say this to anybody. And then what happened to me happened. So... What about you, Mr., how do you pronounce your last name? Nusatelli.

      My next move, I went into my house after it left. I made sure no one had been abducted. And I picked up the landline. I called the Security Forces Command Center. I reported it. I requested that they give me a call back and make notifications up the chain of command. I got a call back in about 15 minutes. They reported that the weather station reported no balloons or aircraft, nothing on radar, no aircraft inbound or outbound. So I got that notification. And then within the following day or two, me and the other witnesses wrote statements, we prepared a report, and then we filed all that information.

       Landline Reporting
      </h3>
      <p>
       In the past, landlines were a common method of communication before cell phones became widely available. When an incident occurred, individuals would use their home or office landline phone to report it to relevant authorities or emergency services. This was especially important in situations where there was no other means of communication available.

      We've been talking about this for 20 years. We don't know what we saw. What we saw changed our lives and the way we think about everything. It was incredibly profound. The object I saw, I don't even know if it was an object. It was a light. It was an orb. It didn't look like a craft, but it did look solid. And that's what we talk about. We noticed the object, and this was a pattern across all the encounters. Someone would see a light. They would pay attention to the light. And then the object responds, it performs for you. And then they come down and they investigate you. So it's almost like they're curious. So that's the thing we primarily talk about. Why did it come after we noticed it? Maybe it noticed us after we noticed it. I now recognize Representative Mace for five minutes.

      That's a complicated question. So being here today, if I say the wrong word, technically I can be charged with espionage. Espionage is a death penalty. Whistleblowers have faced it. John Cariocco, for example. I am not scared for my physical safety in the sense of an agency or company coming to kill me. But I have no job. My career has been tarnished. You know, I'm unemployed, living off of unemployment for the next three, four weeks until that's gone. So it's a complicated question. Have there been stories leaked about your life to try to discredit you in the public eye? As of now, I don't know.

       Compartmentalization is a security practice used by governments and organizations to limit access to sensitive information within their ranks. This involves dividing information into smaller, more manageable parts and restricting access based on need-to-know principles. The goal of compartmentalization is to prevent unauthorized disclosure or misuse of classified data.

    Compartmentalization of Information and Potential Government Cover-Ups
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The Congressional hearing discussed how the U.S. government compartmentalizes information about classified programs, making it difficult for Congress to oversee where taxpayer money is being spent. Witnesses also mentioned potential cover-ups by the government in relation to UFO sightings and crash retrieval programs. They emphasized that national security concerns are often used as a pretext for classification, which hinders transparency and oversight efforts.

      This is what the U.S. government does, right? They compartmentalize the information. Certain people know the name of the program. And if you don't know it, you can't get the information. If you don't have the name, you don't know what to ask for. Even when we're reviewing the budget, we go into a SCIF, we look at DOD budget and the budget of like black box programs, and we don't know what we're looking at because we don't know what these programs are. Is it a way for the government to hide from Congress what's really going on and where the money's going? In my opinion, absolutely, yes.

      Entirely possible. Our government and other governments have admitted that they've tried to use UFOs to cover secret projects. But I think they also do some reverse engineering of those claims. So years after people start seeing UFOs over Area 51, for example, They come up with a story, oh yeah, that was, we planted that story. So I read in a major newspaper just a couple of weeks ago, they planted this story, an Air Force colonel went out into the desert, went to a bar at Rachel, and gave them some fake UFO photos, and that's how the whole story about Area 51 started, which is preposterous.

      Generally speaking, we would advise this Congress to ensure that agencies adopt general policy in favor of disclosure instead of a knee-jerk needing to over classify information and documents. We should ensure that when information is classified or deemed sensitive, it's only for legitimate national security and privacy concerns. And we would recommend adding additional factors to the considerations of cost value and certainly to the extent that it's critical for the public interest and the public's right to know, especially when we are talking about these very serious national security concerns and implications.

       General Policy on Disclosure
      </h3>
      <p>
       The speaker is advocating for a general policy in favor of disclosure, meaning that agencies should prioritize transparency and release information to the public unless there are legitimate national security or privacy concerns. This approach aims to balance the need for secrecy with the public's right to know about important issues affecting their lives.

      Absolutely. So again, Congress has always relied on whistleblowers coming forward and making disclosures in a number of different issues across different agencies, anything from national security to airline safety, railway safety, environmental concerns, workplace health and safety, a lot of issues coming out of the COVID pandemic, for example. Whistleblowers have come forward with important disclosures on just about any critical issue affecting our government and affecting the American people, all of which have grave implications for the rights and protections that we have and how we live our lives in communities across the country.

       A whistleblower is an individual who exposes wrongdoing within an organization, often at great personal risk. In this context, whistleblowers play a crucial role in bringing attention to national security concerns and other critical issues that may be hidden from the public eye.

      It's absolutely vital. This has been one of the disappointing failures of doing this work of advocating for stronger whistleblower protections. We recognize the invaluable public service that brave whistleblowers play in coming forward. Again, taking all of these risks that we've heard about just to speak the truth, to get important information out in the public consciousness, but they can only do so when we have safe and secure channels for reporting, when there is trust in the independence of agency watchdogs like inspectors general, like the Office of Special Counsel, like the Merit Systems Protection Board that play critical roles in investigating whistleblower disclosures and enforcing the protections of whistleblowers. All of that is essential to allow whistleblowers to keep coming forward and playing these incredibly important public roles.

      Thank you so much. Let me just say this. People look at Congress, especially now, and they see a lack of unity. They don't see the ability for us to come together really on much of anything. I will say that I do applaud the Chairwoman and the work of this committee because for once I feel like we are focusing on governing, which should be about transparency. The reality is that we cause more harm than good when we allow a lack of transparency to fester. It allows for all types of conspiracy theories instead of us actually making the investments that we need to make to get the information and actually provide it to the American people. The reason that I wanted to focus on making sure that we answer some questions specifically around the protections of those that are willing to come forward is because the only way that we can make this government actually work for all of us is if no matter where you are in this federal government, you feel as if you are safe when you come forward with information of any issue. And so I do wanna thank you for all of your stories.

I want to remind people, too, this thing is an ongoing deal. We're not going to get this overnight. We've been fighting this battle, some of y'all, for 30 years and maybe longer. I hope we... is keep focused on what we're trying to get to as total disclosure. We get a little wrapped up in a lot of things, but the government has something and they need to turn it over to us. We pay their dadgum salary, you pay our salary, and you oughta get more out of us than you do. And that's what disgusts me about this whole thing. I think they're just trying to run the clock out on us, really. They'll poke us a little and they'll make jokes to us and try to pull us off the target. But I think we know where we're at. And that's why they're firing at us, because we are over the target. My first question is Mr. Knapp. I recently introduced the UAP Whistleblower Protection Act to help provide whistleblower protection to federal personnel for disclosing the use of federal taxpayer funds to investigate UFOs.

    Unleashing the Dogs of Investigation and Tracking Down UAP Funding
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In a Congressional hearing, George Knapp (Journalist &amp; Witness) emphasizes the importance of investigating private contractors who have been given government funds for UFO research but may be hiding information from FOIA requests. They suggest that even with security clearances, it is difficult to trace where this money goes due to limited access and classified standards set by these contractors. Rep. Tim Burchett (Committee Member) expresses concern about people not knowing what they are looking at when examining UAP-related materials, while also questioning the acquisition of Russian UAP documents by George Knapp (Journalist &amp; Witness). The institutional significance lies in Congress's oversight role over government spending on UFO research and ensuring transparency within private contractor activities.

      I think you've got to unleash the dogs and go track down the money and where it goes because a lot of this stuff has been moved out of government. As you know, Rep Burchett, it's been given to private contractors who stashed it away. They've had it for so long that there's nobody left inside government or very few who know where it is. And they do that to keep us from FOIA, correct? Yeah, it's to keep it from FOIA. And I think that the contractors who've had this stuff for a very long time set their own standards about who is allowed to know what. And it's a very small group that ever cracks that. I think Representative Luna has been looking at the use of classifications to hide things. I'm not sure that even this committee getting security clearances that should allow you to see this stuff would allow you to follow where it really goes.

       FOIA
      </h3>
      <p>
       The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law that grants the public access to government records, including documents, emails, and other materials. It allows individuals or organizations to request information from federal agencies, which are required by law to disclose such records unless they fall under specific exemptions or exceptions. In this context, Rep. Knapp suggests that private contractors have been using FOIA as a means of hiding their activities related to UFO research.

      I don't think they've made much progress from the people that I've talked to. I don't think they've made much progress in learning that technology. Might have made some. But you wonder, you know, the implication is Tic Tac. Oh, yeah, that's ours. What flew over Washington DC in 52, is that ours too? When are you gonna break that out? You guys authorized tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars on weapons systems that can't do half of what we've seen UFOs do. So when do they break this out if it's really a classified project could change the world? I don't think they've made much progress. I think they've been lying to us and to you and the rest of the world and they're still doing it.

      I did something pretty dumb. And I'm bitter about it, but go ahead. I did something kind of dumb. I met with these officials who, during that time period, Glasnost, Perestroika, the Russians were trying to open up to the world. And I saw it as a window of opportunity, and it was. And we were able to talk these folks into providing us information that otherwise we would never have seen. Some of that was classified. I found out that they only stamped the top pages of these documents that were classified. So I just removed them. I removed those pages, and I carried them out. And if they'd caught me, I'd be in a gulag still.

      Well, there were. The first thing that happened when I talked about this after getting back and going through the files and things and sifting through it, the Russian physicist who had helped us introduce all these people wrote back and said there was a huge eruption, that there was the real far autocratic forces that wanted a return of the USSR had really go after these guys. They described them as traitors. Nikolai Kapranov, the physicist friend of mine said, look, if this has happened five years earlier, we would be in prison. If it happened 10 years earlier, we would have been shot. Luckily at that point, Putin was not in power, but none of those people that we talked to on that trip in 1993 would ever talk to me again. I went back in 1996 and it was like I had the plague. I spoke to different people, But they were scared. And eventually, the story was spun where the Ministry of Defense officials who gave us this information were described as ufologists who said there was nothing really significant to these files. They didn't really find anything a big deal. And I can tell you, you'll see those files that I shared with you. They did find stuff.

      There was an incident in October of 1982 over at ICBM base where UFOs popped up, was observed over this base where the missiles are pointed at us, United States. These UFOs perform incredible maneuvers, they split apart, they fuse back together, they'd appear and disappear and right at the end of this four hour period, The launch control codes for the ICBMs lit up. Something entered the correct codes. The missiles were fired up and ready to launch, and they could not shut it down. The Russian officers were panicking. The UFOs, they disappeared. The launch control system goes back to normal. Colonel Sokolov and his team came in, took the thing apart, could not figure out what it was. It wasn't a power surge or EMPs or some of the baloney excuses that our country has given for similar events involving our nuclear missiles. They thought it was a message from wherever the UFOs were from. And that's a chilling thing. I mean, we were a couple of seconds away from World War III starting, and the UFOs were responsible for it.

    Summary: During a Congressional hearing on UFOs (UFO), witnesses testified about their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) encounters aboard the USS Jackson and at Red Square. The lack of follow-up from government agencies was highlighted, as well as concerns over destroyed records by the Air Force that hindered investigations into UAP sightings. Institutional significance: This testimony highlights potential issues in reporting and investigating UFOs within the military and intelligence community, raising questions about transparency and accountability in addressing these phenomena.

Within the event happening, my duties are to report to the tactical action officer on watch while we're standing watch. So tactical action officer was there. I made my report. I've not had any discussion outside of that day. There's been no communication to me or requests from me to, you know, within side of the military. Speaking of that actual incident itself, once the report was made to the tactical action officer, that's when I made the decision to ask the individual watchstander that was controlling SAFIRE to be able to slew into the location. And that's what you see in the video itself is when the watchstander is slewing in and kind of showing us what we're looking at. But outside of that, that's as far as the reporting went that I know of.

    Whistleblower Protection and UAP Disclosure Efforts
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The Congressional hearing focused on whistleblower protection for national security personnel involved in UFO investigations and the need to ensure transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) encounters. Testimonies highlighted concerns about retaliation against whistleblowers, reliance on internal administrative processes through agency inspector generals, and the blocking of information disclosure by government agencies. The discussion emphasized the importance of protecting witnesses who come forward with UAP-related evidence and ensuring that Congress has access to relevant materials for oversight purposes.

      Congresswoman, this is one of the biggest concerns that we at POGO have, basically around the independence of investigations and accountability for retaliation. Basically, yes, national security whistleblowers have to rely on internal administrative processes that go through agency inspector generals. There are some differentiations, but the bottom line is that they are forced to rely on protection from the same agencies and people who they are alleging retaliated against them.

He courageously stepped forward and was as a witness. I encourage everybody to look and seek his testimony. I wanna thank the people that came in our first hearing. Ryan Graves, David Grush, David Fravor, and in our second hearing, Admiral Gallaudet, Lou Elizondo, and Mr. Gold, and the many others that have come forward. We hear you, and it's time that we, enough is enough, it's time that we take action. Look, I'm not jumped to the conclusion that I believe that there are aliens coming from another planet, but I'm open to that. And I think that it's our responsibility, especially when we're seeing that we have a government that is blocking, actively blocking information from us.

      And conveniently, it was named non-germane, mostly deemed by staff, not even an elected official. This is the kind of stuff that we repeatedly see. Last year, we were blocked by someone in House administration from being able to receive a full briefing from Arrow. So not an elected official, but someone in staff blocked us. And I've had it, enough is enough. I wanna queue up a video that I've been given. And before it starts, I'm gonna describe. This was taken October 30th of 2024. This video is of an MQ-9 drone tracking an orb, or this object, off the coast of Yemen. You'll see that another MQ-9 launched a Hellfire missile. You cannot see that drone. And I'm not gonna explain it to you. You'll see exactly what it does. This is when it zoomed out, so you can still see it traveling.

      I have heard about events like this. I have heard about this event. Jeremy Corbell and I talked about it in one of our episodes a while back. We did not have the video, though. There are servers where there's a whole bank of these kind of videos that Congress has not been allowed to see, that the public hasn't been allowed to see. Occasionally some of that stuff gets out in the wild and it comes our way. It should be going to you. The public should be seeing this stuff. And why you're not allowed to, I don't know. But that's a hellfire missile smacking into that UFO and just bounced right off. And it kept going.

      Dr. Lukatsky is an honorable man who served most of his career with the DIA, a very trusted high-level rocket scientist and intelligence analyst who inspired the OSAP program, as I said earlier. And in full disclosure, I've co-written two books with him. He dropped this on myself and our other co-author out of the blue. And it took 14 months for us to get DOPSA approval for him to release two sentences on that. He said this craft We had managed to get inside of it. It had no wings, no rotor, no tail. It had no fuel, no fuel tanks. They didn't know how it flew or how it was operated. It clearly looked like it was aerodynamic, but he would not go further. He's a by-the-book guy, and until he gets clearance to say more about that, I don't think we're going to hear much more. it's not hours it wasn't hours we didn't make it we didn't know who made it and how it was built and how it operated we've got at least one and i don't know i think that's enough confirmation that we've we do have uh... but that's the desks and material lastly mister borland

    Whistleblower Testimonies and Retaliation Concerns
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In a Congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), witnesses discuss the importance of whistleblowers in exposing fraud and abuse within federal agencies. They highlight examples such as the 2014 VA waitlist scandal and the Doge security data breach. The discussion also addresses retaliation faced by whistleblowers under the Trump administration, including mass firings, undermining independent watchdogs, and abusing the security clearance process to suppress dissenting voices.

      Thank you, Madam Chair. I think we need to make sure that we don't get distracted by sensational stories only of unidentified anomalous phenomena and lose track of what the core of this hearing is about. This is all a perfect example of why whistleblowers are so important and why it's so important that we step up and protect them. With Trump, RFK Jr., EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, and others committed to dismantling government and firing professionals who do dare to speak out against the threats this administration's disastrous policies create, we have to focus on protecting all whistleblowers, not only the ones who are reporting on UAP. I'd like to thank the whistleblowers who have agreed to come before the committee today and speak their truth. This administration's claims to care about waste, fraud and abuse and so often it is the whistleblowers who care and who are the tip of the sword fighting against the real waste, fraud and abuse. One study found that whistleblowers expose fraud at more than twice the rate of third party auditors. So Mr. Spielberger, what are some of the best examples of whistleblowers exposing fraud and abuse in the federal government?

      Thank you, Congresswoman. Again, whistleblowers have played such a vital role across so many different issues. One prominent example goes back to the 2014 VA waitlist scandal. POGO actually played a very instrumental role coordinating with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. At that time, we received tips and whistleblower disclosures from over 800 different individuals talking about the VA subjecting veterans to extensive wait times in order to get the basic standard of care that they deserve. It certainly prolonged serious illnesses, even contributing to hastened deaths, and we were able to help shed more light on that issue, which I think just emphasizes the importance, even outside of the national security context, we are often still talking about serious issues and even life and death concerns.

      So we've certainly heard about a number of different examples of retaliation. One that I'd like to highlight that Mr. Borland referenced previously is retaliation through abuse of the security clearance process. That can have grave implications not just for a whistleblower, but also their ability to seek legal counsel and defend themselves against retaliation. And when we look at the past several months of this administration, unfortunately, we've seen a really systematic approach toward dismantling the nonpartisan civil service. We've seen the mass firings. We've seen undermining of independent agency watchdogs, mass firings of inspectors general, undermining the Office of Special Counsel, the Merit Systems Protection Board. these entities that are meant to be independent and play a critical role in investigating whistleblower disclosures and ensuring that their rights are protected.

      In 1989, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act and then broadened it again in 2012 to ensure that federal workers could feel free to come forward to their elected officials. And it's a good thing we did because whistleblowers have played a more important role than ever since Trump has taken office. It was thanks to a whistleblower that we learned that Doge allegedly put every single American's personal security information at risk by bypassing safeguards and copying all this data to an unsecure server. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a New York Times article titled, quote, Doge put critical social security data at risk. Whistleblower says. Thanks. We've had whistleblowers at the National Labor Relations Board reveal that Doge minions may have shipped case files outside of the agency, possibly to help then co-president Elon Musk continue to exploit his workers. And last week, whistleblowers at the National Institute of Health came forward to say that RFK Jr. 's vaccine misinformation campaign, have pervaded even the highest levels of the agency.

      Typically, whistleblowers have an inspector general they can rely on to investigate their claims and register issues with agency leadership, but President Trump has fired or demoted over 20 inspectors general. If I may ask one more question, Mr. Spielberger, can you explain how eroding the independence and capabilities of inspectors general further endanger these whistleblowers?

    Whistleblower Protections and Independent Watchdog Role
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The speaker emphasized the importance of whistleblowers' protection mechanisms and their role as independent watchdogs in ensuring accountability for enforcing UAP-related disclosures. They highlighted the challenges faced by whistleblowers, including potential erosion of entities responsible for protecting them, which could impact the integrity of investigations and findings. Additionally, they questioned whether these entities would continue to act independently or become lapdogs for political figures.

      absolutely so again whistleblowers already face incredibly great challenges in coming forward under normal circumstances and when we erode these entities that are expected and required to enforce whistleblower protections fairly investigate their disclosures it calls into question the integrity of their investigations and findings whether they'll take whistleblowers seriously when they come forward and whether we can trust that they will use their authority to enforce the protections of whistleblowers who do come forward, essentially whether they will continue in their role as an independent watchdog or basically become a lapdog for a current or future president. And I will take no more liberties. I yield back. I now recognize Mr. Crane for five minutes.

    UAP Whistleblower Testimonies and Oversight Challenges
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In a Congressional hearing on UFOs/UAPs, whistleblowers from the Navy and other branches of government testified about their experiences with reprisal for disclosing information related to unidentified aerial phenomena. The witnesses discussed how they faced disciplinary action or lost security clearances after coming forward with their knowledge. They also highlighted institutional reasons behind the lack of transparency in U.S. government regarding these issues, including fears of public panic and misuse of national security funds by corporations involved in reverse engineering efforts. Institutional Significance: The discussion underscores ongoing challenges faced by whistleblowers who attempt to disclose information about UFOs/UAPs within the federal bureaucracy, as well as potential consequences for those seeking transparency on this topic. It also highlights concerns related to national security and technological advancement in relation to unidentified aerial phenomena.

      I think there's probably multiple reasons. At the start, when these things first started invading our skies in large numbers, we were scared. It was right after World War II. And we didn't know what they were. And they didn't want to panic the public. And that was probably a good call. Over time, I think the lying sort of became institutionalized. Flights over Washington, DC in 1952, they're seen. They're captured on radar. Jets are chased after these objects. And then we get an explanation, it was a temperature inversion. Those kind of lies have been told for a long time. What was told to me by an investigator from Congress, a guy named Richard D'Amato, who was sent after this story by Robert Byrd and Harry Reid, he came out to Nevada, tried to get into Area 51, did get in there, looked around, talked to people, trying to get to the bottom of it. He believed that this program, reverse engineering, et cetera, was inside, had been moved inside these corporations. And he said, when this comes out, people are going to go to prison. And he meant people who were basically misusing legitimate national security funds, tens of billions of dollars, in order to keep this cover-up going.

      I also believe there's a legitimate reason for the cover-up in that there is undeniable connection of national security involved in this technology. If we are racing for it to master that technology against the Russians and the Chinese, which is what I have been told by Senator Reid and many others, then it is a race that's critical to our survival. There could be a form of disclosure, I think. Yes, it's real. It's from somewhere else without revealing all the details that would allow someone else to have an advantage in the race for this technology.

      Finally, I'd like to enter into the testimony a letter I sent to the DOD regarding the case of Major David Charles Grush, a UAP whistleblower who's been extremely helpful to this committee. Unfortunately, due to his participation in the disclosure of UAP, he suffered reprisal like the removal of his clearance, denial of promotion, and loss of medical retirement. I wrote the DOD on July 24th, 2025, On behalf of Major Grush, and I'm still waiting for a reply, I appreciate any help the committee can offer to get a response. Thank you, I yield back.

And they hired a whole team to go through them and retranslate them and analyze it, and they created a structure of how the UFO programs in the USSR and Russia were put together.

    Active Duty Navy Member Testimony and Whistleblower Protection Act Discussion
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The active duty navy member testifies that they lack a clear way to report unusual phenomena without fear of reprisal. They suggest providing standard procedures for reporting such incidents, ensuring no retaliation occurs. Congressman praises the witness's courage and highlights the Witness Protection Act filed by Representative Burchett, which aims to protect whistleblowers from any form of retribution. The UAP Disclosure Act is also discussed as a potential solution to force private companies with knowledge of UFO phenomena to reveal their findings. However, it faces challenges due to resistance from those who have been lying about the subject for decades.

      Thank you, sir. As a active duty Navy member, our mission is to carry out the ship's mission or the command's mission. And we, on a general basis, don't have knowledge of what to do when we see things like this. We just don't. We're there to do our mission and do what's told of us. So I think what would be important is giving active duty members a clear way of being able to report things like this to where it gets to this point. And ensuring that we have a standard level of understanding that there wouldn't be any level of reprisal or anything happening Because, you know, I've been in the Navy for almost 24 years, but what about the sailors that have been in for two years that experience things like this? They're not going to have the knowledge or they'll probably be a little bit more fearful to speak up, being it that their career is just starting.

      Anyone on the committee familiar with it? It's fantastic. It's the language that we need. It's language that will protect whistleblowers from any kind of reprisal, and yet it's again and again blocked by this body in some way. Many times it's being blocked not by elected officials, but by staff behind the scenes. The other bill, the UAP Disclosure Act, which was filed last year, Senator Schumer, who I cannot believe that there's a topic that he and I agree on, but he and I agree on this topic. He has sponsored it in the Senate. He put it on the National Defense Authorization Act last year. Remarkably, It was stripped out by the House last year and I can't get it onto the bill leaving the House this year.

The keepers of the secrets, the private companies that have been doing this job for intelligence agencies for a long time are not going to cough it up. You'd have to force it out of them.

      You know, I would put it to you this way. The statement Arrow has made is scientific evidence of extraterrestrials. Scientific evidence requires a scientific control. Extraterrestrial is an entity on another planet. The only way to scientifically prove extraterrestrial is we have to go to that planet, acquire technology, bring it back, and compare it to what we have here.

      That would be scientific evidence, yes.

    UAP Witness Testimonies and After-Action Investigations
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The witnesses discussed their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) at military bases during sensitive operations. They emphasized the lack of after-action investigations, documentation, or interviews from higher authorities despite potential impacts on national security interests. This highlights a gap in UAP oversight and raises questions about government involvement or awareness of these incidents.

      Thanks, Madam Chair. I think I'll start with maybe Mr. Borland. So you have a clearance, right? You're in uniform. You have a clearance. When did you leave service? I left in 2013, February 13. Who was the president, if you recall? 2013 would have been President Obama, sir. Wasn't President Trump, right? So you have a clearance, right? You're serving in uniform. You have a clearance. Yes, sir. Your story, I think many of us are kind of picturing the scene. You walk out in the flight line having a smoke. this event occurs. Do you have the perception, at least I do, based on your story, that this involves the U.S. Whatever you saw involves the U.S. That is 100 percent my opinion then and now.

      Security forces in uniform or contract? Probably both. Did you talk to them? Did anybody talk to them in an after action? Not to my knowledge, sir. Is there any interest in the command to determine and verify what you saw? Not to my knowledge, sir. It's unfortunate. Chief Wiggins, thank you for your service. Gentlemen, thank you, all of you, for your courage to be here. Your story's a little bit different. Sounds like it, well, for both of you guys, and also Mr. Nusatelli, If this were sanctioned by the US government, even though you have a clearance, but it's classified above the clearance level, do you see any reason why they would allow you access, being present, viewing it, hearing it, being around it, is this an accident? Does the US government make these kind of, they make accidents, mistakes like this? We're doing this test of this new system and we forgot these guys were standing here. Does that sound like something that the US government would do?

    After-Action Reports and Whistleblower Protection
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The discussion revolves around after-action reports conducted by the Navy following UAP incidents and whistleblowers' protection in disclosing such information. Chief Alexandro Wiggins (UAP Witness) confirms that there was no after-action report for a specific incident, highlighting potential gaps in accountability. Rep. Andy Biggs (Committee Member) emphasizes the need to protect whistleblowers, citing examples of retaliation against credible witnesses from both political parties. The discussion also touches upon Arrow, an organization created by Congress to handle UAP witnesses and whistleblowers, which has faced criticism for its handling of cases.

       Special Access Programs (SAP)
      </h3>
      <p>
       SAPs are highly classified government programs designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access. They often involve compartmentalization, where only a select group of individuals with specific security clearances have access to the program's details. The mention of SAPs in this context suggests that some aspects of UAP investigations may be hidden within these restricted programs, making it difficult for elected representatives and the public to obtain information about them.

      Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to the witnesses for being here today. I'll tell you that today's testimony should alarm every American no matter their views on UAPs. This isn't simply about UAPs. It's about government integrity, responsible use of taxpayer funds, and Congress's constitutional duty to oversee the executive branch. I've heard evidence of critical information hidden in special access programs off limits to virtually every elected representative. and certainly to the public. Credible witnesses report retaliation for speaking out. These are clear attempts to silence those who are exposing the truth. We must protect the whistleblowers. Decades of government disinformation have eviscerated public trust. So this isn't a partisan matter, it's a constitutional matter, and when you talk about the VAs, Mrs. Spielberger, and all the problems that they had, the hub of that was Phoenix. and they went after the whistleblowers there, and that was under the Obama administration. So it doesn't matter which administration, which party, both parties have got to come clean, particularly on this.

       Whistleblowers
      </h3>
      <p>
       A whistleblower is an individual who exposes wrongdoing or misconduct within an organization, often at personal risk. In this context, witnesses are discussing potential retaliation against individuals who have spoken out about their experiences with UAPs and related incidents. This highlights the importance of protecting whistleblowers to ensure that they can share information without fear of reprisal.

      It's a combination of factors. First, you check their credentials. Did they really serve where they said they did, and did they work where they said they did? Are there any other witnesses? Is there visual proof, film, footage, things of that sort? You ask the people around them that know them, that used to work with them, if they're credible people. That's one way. I think about Arrow, the organization that this body created. to deal with witnesses and whistleblowers i hope i'm not taking too much of your time here but they invited people to come forward service members who knew saw things and had experiences and i can tell you that the people that i have talked to who went through that are deeply disappointed there was a guy named bob jacobs who was a lieutenant attached to vandenberg in 1964 his unit would would record missile tests they recorded all of them on one of this particular attest a ufo comes out of nowhere zaps what looks like a laser beam at what would have been a nuclear dump dummy a nuclear weapon and disabled and he is called into the commander's office uh... two guys in suits clip that film footage out that shows the UFO, and he's ordered to never talk about it.

      He comes forward to Arrow. He heeds the call, thinking he's doing his duty as an American to tell that story, and they completely dismissed him. They made up a story that they had tracked down the original footage, and there was nothing like that in it. Well, there was no original footage. It had been taken away the day the footage was recorded. He's deeply disappointed. People like Bob Salas, who had worked at a nuclear ICBM base, who saw UFOs flying over the base and these missile silos were taken down, he went to Arrow, too, and was completely disregarded. It almost looks like Arrow operated as a counterintelligence operation to get people to come in, tell their stories, and then discredit all of them. I can't imagine that any whistleblower or witness will ever go to Arrow again because of what happened under the first director, who's now long gone. but still seems to act as the spokesperson for that organization.

    Subpoena Request and Congressional Access to UAP Records
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: During a congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), witnesses discuss the possibility of issuing subpoenas for relevant records held by private entities like Arrow Corporation and the FBI. The discussion also touches upon access restrictions faced by Congress in obtaining unclassified Air Force documents related to previous incidents involving UAPs. Additionally, questions are raised about whether physical effects or security system disruptions were documented during these events. Institutional Significance: This exchange highlights congressional efforts towards transparency and oversight of government agencies handling sensitive information regarding UAP encounters while emphasizing the importance of maintaining national security protocols when sharing classified data with lawmakers.

    UAP Disclosure Efforts and Executive Branch Oversight
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: In a Congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) disclosure efforts, witnesses discussed the involvement of contractors like Lockheed Martin in handling sensitive information related to UAPs. The CIA was mentioned as one intelligence agency involved in providing classified material about UAPs to these contractors. Witnesses also highlighted that despite leaked videos and public interest, there is a reluctance among authorities to disclose this information due to concerns over the public's ability to handle it. The hearing emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation and commitment from Congress to address this issue thoroughly and transparently.

      Well, one of them was named Dr. James Ryder at Lockheed. But again, to emphasize, I don't fault these contractors for doing what they were asked to do by our government. They're supposed to lie if people ask about it. The intelligence agencies who gave this stuff to them, CIA, I think, primarily, told them to keep it quiet, and they've done that. And I suspect that they'd like an off-ramp, that they'd like some help with figuring out this technology at some point.

      Well, the secret's out. I mean, how many videos have there been already? You know, videos that are leaked from within the military and intelligence agencies and contractors and censor platforms. It's out there. But they have the high ground. The people that don't want us to take it seriously dismiss it, discredit the witnesses, come up with a cover story. I mean, it's been out there a long time. The public senses that it's real, and the people in authority dismiss them. It's a game that's been going on a long time, and I don't think they're ever going to release it. I think that there's an attitude among the people that have been involved in this for a long time that the public doesn't deserve to know and that the public probably can't handle it, but they can.

    Task Force Update and Witness Testimonies on UAP Encounters
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The task force chair provides an update on their authority limitations and plans to request immunity for witnesses. They discuss the release of alleged Russian crash retrieval documents, which contain new information about a Thread 3 program within the Soviet government. Witnesses with sensor training are asked to analyze video footage of UAP encounters. A witness from the USS Gettysburg shares his experience witnessing an encounter on board and discusses how it was discussed among crew members.

      Task force. So the task force to answer that question has to do it through full committee. OK. And also in regards to immunity, which to Mr. Borland's point, we are going to be doing a motion to ask for immunity. For you and a few other people to come into a skiff and tell us what you know without being subject to the Espionage Act etc Thank you, man so that's just kind of an update but as a task force because we're not a full subcommittee and there are certain authorities that haven't been granted to us probably Because they don't want us to have it but there are ways to work around it. So we're kind of figuring that out pursuant to committee rule 9c the majority and minority will have an additional 30 minutes each to ask questions of the witnesses without objection and So ordered. With that being said, if you guys want to jump in the queue, I know Representative Crane, Burleson, and likely Burchett have a few more questions. I'll just start out with two, and then I'll pass the buck to Burleson. Burchett, do you have anything? Birchett and then Crane. Just real quick, Mr. Knapp, and short answers, please, because of time.

So, I mean, percentage-wise of the documents that you submitted to Congress, what was public already and what was not newly released? Okay, so the rest of it should be predominantly new information. Also, can you just elaborate real quick? I know you had, I think, mentioned a Thread 3 program, but also alleged in those documents, I got through maybe half of them last night. There's a lot, and I don't speak Russian, contrary to what my people might allege.

    Visual and Radar Observations of UAPs by Navy Personnel
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: During a Congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), Chief Wiggins testified about his visual and radar observations while serving in the US Navy. He described seeing an object emerge from the ocean, ascend rapidly into the air at speeds approaching Mach 1 or 2, and then disappear nearly instantly after remaining stationary for a period of time. The other three objects were detected on radar but not visually by Wiggins. This testimony highlights the importance of UAP reporting protocols in military contexts to prevent potential misunderstandings with foreign adversaries. Institutional Significance: The discussion underscores the need for improved communication and coordination between different branches of government, including Congress, executive agencies like the Department of Defense (DoD), and intelligence organizations such as the National Security Agency (NSA) when it comes to UAP sightings. It also emphasizes how these incidents can have real-world implications on national security and international relations.

      When I first witnessed off the port bridge wing the object moving out of the water, what I thought was originally just a light on the water, something on the horizon, and surfacing and going into the air, I then knew it was an air contact. As an air controller myself, I started thinking and going through kind of like my checklist in my mind, could it be a helo, but it's not blinking lights. So I then realized this is something I've never seen before. So the speed itself just going from the horizon to about maybe 3,000, 4,000 feet in the air was very slow, slowly rising. It sped up, I'm not an expert at knowing specific speeds of aircraft just by visual eye, but I would say probably one, two mach instantly into the rest of the formation. I didn't notice visually with my own eyes the other three objects until I went back to my radar and also utilized SAFIRE to see that in fact there were four total. and then again, when they all left after a certain amount of time, it was nearly instantaneous.

      That part I couldn't tell because it was nighttime at 1915 approximately, and it was also at a distance. So it's very hard to tell the difference between something on the horizon and something surfacing from the water. My personal thoughts after seeing what I saw is that it did in fact come from the water, but I don't have visual evidence showing exactly you know that it did in fact come from the water but I had again I had to go through my process of elimination and try to figure out was this a ship on the horizon just showing its lights at night but to see its surface then it made me question okay where did this come from if it's flying and it's not a drone or anything like that where was its origin where did it start

You know, the question is, and I posed it in one of the previous hearings, is it ours, is it theirs, or is it otherworldly? There may not be a silver bullet at the moment, but when you look back through the hearing and the evidence that's been presented, if you were going to point the American people to one piece of evidence to start their journey on this topic, what would you suggest, sir?

      Well, I mean, you bring an interesting point. In the law enforcement community, any time you're conducting an investigation, you're always looking at the totality of the circumstances. You're looking at all the evidence and how they piece together. And so that would be my advice to the American people, that this is a journey that is just beginning. from a congressional perspective, but you have decades of data, some of it not real, much of it is, but thanks to Chairwoman Luna, we're now presenting this to the American people. And I think this latest video from Mr. Burleson is something that should get everyone pause. When you see the three orbs that drop, was that in a defensive posture or was that in an offensive posture? And what capabilities did those orbs have that we, quite frankly, may not have?

   <h2>
    Testifying on UFO Paper Trail and Russian Encounters
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: The hearing focused on testimonies from witnesses who discussed a paper trail of documents related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that contradict official statements about their existence. They also shared accounts of encounters between Russian warplanes and UFOs, where pilots were ordered not to engage with the craft after several crashes occurred when they attempted to fire upon them. The speakers emphasized the importance of acknowledging these incidents as a potential national security threat and urged for more transparency in government investigations into UAP phenomena. Institutional Significance: This discussion highlights how congressional hearings serve an oversight function by providing a platform for experts, witnesses, and policymakers to share information on critical issues such as UFOs and their implications for national security. The testimonies presented during this hearing contribute valuable insights that can inform future policy decisions related to UAP disclosure efforts and potential threats posed by unidentified aerial phenomena.

      as i mentioned at the beginning of my remarks what hooked me on the story was the paper trail uh... these documents that shouldn't exist we've been told for decades over and over there's nothing to it it's not a threat you can go about your business and then when folio becomes the law of the land thousands of pages to the contrary, leak out. There's a memo by General Nathan Twining in 1947, when the country was being overflown by dozens of UFOs, hundreds of UFOs, in which he said, look, this is not visionary or fictitious. These things are craft. They're not ours. They outperform anything we've got. I mean, if you follow the paper trail of documents that they wrote before the military got wise and realized that FOIA really exists and changed their tune and not put things in writing, it spells it out pretty clearly. I'll go refer back to Russia. One incident I did not mention to Representative Burleson is, Colonel Sokolov in that Ministry of Defense program said there were 40 incidents where Russian warplanes were sent to intercept UFOs. And they were ordered to fire on them. And for the most part, the UFOs would zip away. Three of the pilots, though, did fire at these things.

      Those three planes stalled out, crashed. Two of those pilots died. And after that, the Russians changed the standing order. If you see a UFO, leave them alone. No country in the world wants to say and admit that these objects are flying around in our airspace, and there's nothing we can do about it. I mean, who wants to say that? certainly doesn't, and the Russians didn't either. And I've got to be almost out of time, but Mr. Berland, then you, sir, real quickly.

They said he never worked where he worked. They said he never did what he did. But yet Bob Lazar showed up with a bunch of friends and a video camera and was filming these test flights in the middle of the desert. So clearly he knew something.

In this segment, the speaker mentions that Lazar filmed test flights of unidentified aircraft in the middle of the desert, which suggests he had insider knowledge about these activities.

      Well, it's splitting hairs, no proof that they're extraterrestrials. What would that proof look like? A piece of kryptonite? What would it be? I mean, we could be talking about different forms of non-human intelligence. I think the dominant paradigm is that they come from outer space, somewhere else, and they have some way that they can cross those vast distances that we can't even imagine doing. But that's not necessarily the answer. So asking for proof of extraterrestrials might not be the answer at all at splitting hairs. We don't know where they're from. I don't know anyone who knows the answer for sure. They call them aliens just as a placekeeper kind of a word. But no one in all these programs who've studied this stuff for years, people with much bigger brains than mine, knows the answer for sure.

      <p>
       The term "back engineering" refers to the process of analyzing a product or technology created by another party and then using that information to create similar products or technologies. In this context, it implies that some people believe that the government has been trying to reverse-engineer alien technology found in crashed UFOs for their own purposes.

And I think that's why the move to discredit folks is so rapid, too. I think, you know, they're just, they point to them and they put the dogs on them. And it disgusts me.

       Billionaire Buddies

      <p>
       The speaker uses the phrase "billionaire buddies" as a metaphorical reference to powerful and wealthy individuals who may have vested interests in maintaining the status quo of energy sources and technologies. This highlights the potential political and economic motivations behind secrecy surrounding UFO research and extraterrestrial encounters.

      There's a price to be paid for that, too. The Russians and Chinese are trying to figure this out as well. But they don't have the same kind of stigma. They tell their best scientists and engineers, get in there and work on it. And they've been doing it for a very long time. Might have a head start on us. Here, we don't have our best scientists and engineers working on it. on it because they've been told it's nonsense. The stigma is very real for people like that. Yield back, Chair Lady.

    Testimony and Oversight of UAP Encounters at Military Installations
   </h2>
   <p>
    Summary: During a Congressional hearing on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) encounters, witnesses shared their experiences with large objects appearing over military installations during critical operations. The discussion highlighted the need for whistleblower protection legislation to encourage individuals to come forward without fear of retribution and emphasized the importance of bipartisan support in addressing UAP-related concerns.

      There are many, many accounts of incursions of this type taking place. I believe in the 60s we had a similar incursion in New England. And the same thing happened. There were these objects coming over the base at low altitude, 200 feet over the base security police. and they were scrambling fighters, and then the objects would just fly off, and that went on for weeks. So the historical record has laid out that there's a pattern, that our installations are visited by these craft, You know, they come in and do whatever they're doing, and then they leave. And we don't know how to respond. We don't know how to protect the installation. So that's why we're here.

We've been, you know, the two, three years, I can only imagine how frustrated Mr. Knapp is or Danny Sheehan is and the amount of time that you guys have poured into this to try to get answers. I mean, Masson is back there. He's been pouring to try to get answers into this. I hope that you all see that we are committed to this and we're gonna be scrappy about it. We may not have the direct authority, but I can assure you Representative Luna is about as scrappy as it gets. I wouldn't wanna scrap with her. But that being said, I think that if the American people want to see answers, we need action. We've had the hearings. It's time to take action. It's time that we pass Tim Burchett's whistleblower act. It's time that we pass the UAP Disclosure Act. And I think that we've had a lot of talk about this. It's time for action.

And so thank you so much again for conducting a bipartisan hearing on such an important matter.

      Thank you. I now like to recognize myself for some closing remarks. This is obviously something that doesn't just affect everyone in this room. I can tell you that specifically for where I represent in Pinellas County, Tampa Bay, and Florida as a whole, there's many sightings, many questions, people reporting this, but I'm not the only one. I was also told by Representative Biggs as well as our great representative from Alaska that these are not isolated instances. And so it does give us reasoning to provide investigative inquiry into these topics. But also too, I would also like Mr. Spielberger, if you could actually review and see if your organization would endorse the Whistleblower Protection Act that Representative Burchett has.

       Whistleblower Act
      </h3>
      <p>
       The Whistleblower Protection Act is proposed legislation aimed at protecting individuals who come forward with information about potential wrongdoing or misconduct within government agencies and organizations. In this context, Representative Luna mentions that passing Tim Burchett's whistleblower act would be an important step towards addressing concerns related to UAPs and ensuring transparency in investigations.

      I can tell you that I will be signing on to a letter as well as I'm sure many other members of this task force, and we hope that the ranking chairwoman or my colleague here, Representative Crockett, as well as our Democrats that were here today, consider also signing on to that as we do feel that it is time to ensure that our whistleblowers are given adequate protections and that people like Mr. Borland are not facing retribution in the way that they have been. With that being said, with all that and without objection, all members have five legislative days within to submit materials and additional written questions for the witnesses which will be also forwarded to those witnesses. If there are no further business, without objection, I'd like to now recognize Representative Burchett for closing remarks.

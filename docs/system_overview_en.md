# üìú System Overview ‚Äì R2 Mechanics (public, non-operational)

This document describes the basic structure, goals, and methodological approach of **R2 Mechanics** ‚Äì a system for structured, privacy-compliant transcription, annotation, and interactive visualization of audio-based content.

The goal is to provide a transparent, yet non-reproducible, description of the system architecture that establishes first-mover claims and offers orientation for potential partners.

## üîß System Structure (abstracted)

### **1. Input Formats**

* Individual audio files (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`)
* Optional: Supplementary metadata such as speaker lists, timecodes, annotations

---

### **2. Processing Steps**

1. **Transcription (local, offline):**

   * CUDA-accelerated
   * WhisperX with speaker diarization
   * Secure, GDPR-compliant operation without cloud

2. **Structuring:**

   * Reading or generating a chapter file (`.txt`)
   * Includes title, start time, description per chapter

3. **LLM-Assisted Analysis:**

   * Local generation of summaries
   * Automatic semantic notes with precise timestamps
   * Formatted as consistent second-based markers

4. **Visual Enrichment:**

   * Chapter-based image generation via Stable Diffusion
   * Local prompt-to-image pipeline
   * Serious, documentary-style illustrations

---

### **3. Output Formats**

* **Interactive HTML Transcript**:

  * Audio player with jump links
  * Automatically generated table of contents (TOC)
  * Chapter headings with SD-generated illustrations
  * Per-chapter summaries
  * Speaker segments with timestamps and roles
  * Integrated notes / side annotations (time-correlated)
  * Fully styled with R2 Mechanics CSS
  * Optional export as static website / GitHub Pages

```

## ‚úÖ Features

* GPU-accelerated local transcription (WhisperX)
* Speaker diarization and timestamp generation
* Automated LLM annotations with exact times
* SD-generated chapter images, fully offline
* HTML export with audio, navigation, jump links
* 100‚ÄØ% offline and auditable ‚Äì no cloud uploads
* Easily integrable into archival or research workflows

---

## üîê Disclosure & Protection

This document serves **transparency-based priority protection**:

* Contains no operational scripts or executable commands
* Methodology is systematically documented but not directly reproducible
* The full system is operated **exclusively locally and offline**

Demo versions and test runs are available for interested institutions upon request.

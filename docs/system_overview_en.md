# System Overview ‚Äì R2 Mechanics (Public, Non-Operational)

This document describes the conceptual structure, objectives, and methodological implementation of **R2 Mechanics** ‚Äì a system for structured, privacy-compliant transcription and visualization of audio-based content.

The goal is to provide a transparent yet non-reconstructable description of the system architecture that secures first-mover claims while offering orientation to potential partners.

## üîß System Structure (Abstracted)

### **1. Input Formats:**
- Individual audio files (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`)
- Optional: supporting files such as speaker lists, time markers, metadata

### **2. Processing Steps:**
1. **Transcription (local):**
   - GPU-accelerated (CUDA)
   - Speaker diarization
2. **Structuring:**
   - Parsing or generating a chapter structure (`.txt`)
   - Including titles, start times, descriptions
3. **Optional LLM-based Processing:**
   - Local generation of summaries or semantic notes
4. **(Optional) Visualization via Image Generator:**
   - Chapter-based scene illustration using prompt-to-image (offline)

### **3. Output Formats:**
- Interactive HTML transcript:
  - Embedded audio player
  - Clickable chapter sections
  - Time markers
  - Optional named speaker identification
  - R2 Mechanics‚Äìstyled CSS

## üîê Disclosure & Protection

This document serves as a **transparency-based priority safeguard**:
- It contains no operational code or scripts
- The methodology is described in a structured but non-reconstructable way
- The complete system runs **locally and offline only**

Demo versions and test runs are available upon request for interested research institutions.
